<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A simple API allowing basic CRUD operations on recipe data stored in an SQLite back-end.

This project is purely for us as a training aid and by no means represents best practice for a production application.

There are a number of outstanding issues, mostly to be left outstanding as an exercise for trainees.

### Built With

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this API you need the following software installed:

- Node.js (created using v14.13.0 but older versions may also be compatible)
- NPM (created using v6.14.8 but older versions may also be compatible)

While not technically required, the following packages are used to help enforce coding standards and, as such, it may be worth hooking up the relevant Visual Studio Code (or other IDE) extension:

- Prettier
- ES Lint

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simon-says-test/training-express-api-sql.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The API can be started as follows:

```sh
npm start
```

The API can be tested using the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/simon-says-test/training-express-api-sql/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues). It is expected that most, if not all, of these should be left open and not fixed on the master branch in order that they remian as an exercise for people using this repository as part of training.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Please note, however, that this repository is purely for training purposes and most issues, tracked or otherwise, are probably not in desperate need of fixing, except as an exercise for those being trained. If there's something you still think would be really useful, then please follow the usual steps:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
